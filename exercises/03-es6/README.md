# ES6

1. Clone or download this repository
2. run `npm install` in the exercises/03-es6 directory
3. run `npm run test:01` to run the unit tests for the first batch of exercises.
4. Fix everything in src/01_var_let_const.js to make all unit tests pass.
5. Go to the next batch of exercises, 01 - 06 (e.g. `npm run test:02`)
6. Run `npm run test:extra` when you're done with the base exercises
7. You can run `npm test` to run all unit tests.

**Additional debugging**

The output of the unit tests can be a overwhelming and make it hard to debug the functions.
You can run `npm start`, open your browser at http://localhost:1234, and open your devtools (f12 / cmd+option+i).

In src/index.js you can import and execute one of the exercises and you'll see the result of the function in your devtools.

Add `console.log` or `debugger;` to the exercises to debug the exercise.
